## OWASP Orlando Chapter Meetings

We schedule our meetings on the [Orlando Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Orlando)

{% include chapter_events.html group=page.meetup-group %}

Our meetings are open to the public, and you do not need to be a member to attend. Please do consider [joining OWASP](https://owasp.org/membership/) if you find our community, projects, and meetings valuable, or sponsoring this chapter.

## Chapter Information

OWASP Orlando is newly formed as of August 2011. The first meeting was held on October 19, 2011 and was designed largely as a social event to bring new members together. After this initial informal meeting we are continuing with quarterly meetings focused on content that attendees can apply within their own environments for minimal or no-cost to their organizations. We do not tolerate vendor-centric presentations but do
encourage vendors to present as long as they can keep their marketing attempts to a minimum and focus on the underlying issues and technology. 

Typically we have 2 speakers with topics designed to meet the needs of the Builder, Breaker and Defender communities. As of April 2012 have continued to meet this commitment. Keep watching this space for announcements about upcoming events. If you are interested in being a speaker or taking a more active leadership role within the chapter, please contact the chapter leaders at the link above. Everyone is welcome to join us at our chapter meetings. We track membership based on participation at the mailing list linked on this page and this will be the primary means of communication for the chapter.
